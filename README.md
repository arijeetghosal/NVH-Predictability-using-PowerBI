Objective: 
Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyses Noise, Vibration, and 
Harshness (NVH) aspects related to vehicle performance. Your goal is to identify 
trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement based on the data you collect or 
generate. 
Instructions: 
1. Data Sourcing or Creation:
 Option 1: Public Data
Source publicly available datasets related to vehicle performance, 
NVH measurements, automotive engineering, or customer feedback. 
Potential sources include: 
• Kaggle Datasets
• UCI Machine Learning Repository
• Government Open Data Portals
• Automotive Industry Reports
Option 2: Synthetic Data
• Create a synthetic dataset that simulates NVH data. 
• Include variables such as: 
• Noise Data: Sound levels (in decibels) from vehicle 
components under various conditions. 
• Vibration Data: Vibration readings from different 
measurement points across various road surfaces. 
• Harshness Data: Customer feedback scores and comments 
on ride comfort and vehicle handling. 
• Time Stamps: Dates and times for each measurement.
• Vehicle Metadata: Information on vehicle models, 
manufacturing dates, and operating conditions. 
• Ensure the dataset has enough records (e.g., at least 500 rows) 
for meaningful analysis. 
2. Data Preparation:
o Import your dataset(s) into Power BI. 
o Clean and preprocess the data: 
▪ Handle missing values and duplicates. 
▪ Correct any inconsistencies or errors. 
o Establish relationships between tables if using multiple 
datasets. 
3. Data Analysis:
o Calculate key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for 
NVH metrics. 
o Identify patterns and trends over time or under different 
conditions. 
o Explore correlations between NVH metrics and other variables 
(e.g., vehicle model, road surface, customer feedback). 
4. Dashboard Creation:
o Design an interactive dashboard with clear and insightful 
visualizations. 
o Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly with proper labels, 
legends, and tooltips. 
o Use charts, graphs, and maps as appropriate (e.g., line charts for 
trends, heat maps for intensity). 
o Implement filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data 
dynamically.
5. Insights and Recommendations:
o Summarize key findings from your analysis. 
o Provide actionable recommendations to improve 
NVH performance. 
o Discuss the potential impact of your recommendations on 
vehicle performance and customer satisfaction.
